# first script attempt
# goals: 
#
# measure F1, F2, F3 11 (?) times equidistant
# Mean F1, F2, F3, amplitude, F0
# length
# 1st quartile amplitude, F0
# 3rd quartile amplitude, F0
# median amplitude, F0

# multiple scripts? one big script?
# multiple seems easier and neater, more modular
# have open in praat or select from directory? multiple vowels? 
# dictionary of lists for sounds in context
# ie CVC : list of relevant numbers in certain order
# or dictionary of dictionary, with value being labeled numbers
# so big for loop should construct a dictionary, add it to other dictionary?

# multiple little pieces 
# measuring total length of ___
# computing average is built in to R
# measure median of ___
# quartile amplitude can call that one...
